### 🏗️ Architecture Improvements

#### Core Components Enhanced:
- **main.go** - Configuration parsing with YAML/JSON support
- **stun.go** - Multi-server NAT detection with caching
- **holepunch.go** - Advanced P2P connection establishment
- **signaling.go** - Real-time mapping synchronization
- **forwarder.go** - P2P-integrated data forwarding
- **mapping_updater.go** - Dynamic configuration management
- **run.go** - Enhanced orchestration and connection management

#### New Infrastructure:

2. **UDP Hole Punch** (minimal overhead) - True P2P tunnels
3. **TCP/UDP Relay** (higher latency) - Universal fallback

#### Resource Management:
- Automatic port allocation and cleanup
- 5-minute room inactivity cleanup
- Memory leak prevention
- Thread-safe concurrent operations

### 🔒 Security & Production Ready
