# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an advanced Go-based P2P NAT traversal tool with **true UDP hole punching** and **dynamic mapping management**. It creates intelligent tunnels between clients and servers behind NATs using enhanced STUN discovery, comprehensive NAT type detection, and an enhanced PHP signaling server for real-time coordination. The system enables automatic port forwarding without manual router configuration while supporting hot configuration updates.

```

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **main.go**: Entry point, configuration validation, CLI argument parsing, supports both YAML and JSON configs
- **types.go**: Enhanced data structures (`Configuration`, `PortMapping`, `NetworkInfo`, `STUNResult`) with flexible JSON/YAML unmarshaling
- **run.go**: Advanced execution logic with client/server modes, enhanced LAN detection, dynamic mapping updates, and concurrent port management
- **stun.go**: Comprehensive STUN implementation with NAT type detection (Full Cone, Restricted Cone, Port Restricted, Symmetric NAT)
- **holepunch.go**: Advanced UDP hole punching with simultaneous connect, port prediction, and multi-strategy fallback
- **signaling.go**: Enhanced HTTP client with mapping update support, version control, and real-time synchronization
- **forwarder.go**: Protocol-specific forwarding with P2P hole punching integration and relay fallback
- **mapping_updater.go**: Dynamic mapping management with interactive CLI and hot configuration updates
- **signaling/signaling_server_enhanced.php**: Advanced PHP signaling server with auto-cleanup, version control, and real-time updates

### Enhanced Client/Server Model with P2P and Dynamic Management

- **Client Mode**: Defines and manages port mappings dynamically, performs NAT detection, establishes P2P or relay connections
- **Server Mode**: Dynamically allocates ports, performs NAT detection, supports real-time mapping updates, manages P2P hole punching
- **Smart Connection Selection**: Multi-strategy approach (LAN Direct ‚Üí UDP Hole Punch ‚Üí TCP/UDP Relay)
- **Real-time Coordination**: Enhanced signaling server with version control, auto-cleanup, and live mapping synchronization
- **Interactive Management**: CLI interface for dynamic mapping updates without service interruption

### Enhanced Data Flow

**Initial Connection:**
1. Both client/server perform comprehensive NAT type detection and network discovery
2. Client posts enhanced network info + mapping requirements to signaling server with version control
3. Server retrieves client requirements and dynamically allocates available ports
4. Server posts network info + port allocation results with mapping version tracking
5. Connection establishment using optimal method (LAN Direct/UDP Hole Punch/TCP Relay)

**Dynamic Updates:**
6. Server continuously monitors for mapping updates via enhanced signaling protocol
7. Client can modify mappings through interactive CLI or configuration changes
8. Server automatically reallocates ports and establishes new connections without interruption
9. Enhanced signaling server provides auto-cleanup (5-minute inactivity timeout)

### Key Improvements

- **Advanced NAT Traversal**: True UDP hole punching with multi-strategy fallback (simultaneous connect, port prediction)
- **Real-time Dynamic Updates**: Hot mapping management without service restart
- **Enhanced Signaling Protocol**: Version control, auto-cleanup, and conflict resolution
- **Comprehensive NAT Detection**: Full Cone, Restricted Cone, Port Restricted, Symmetric NAT identification
- **Smart Connection Optimization**: Automatic LAN detection and P2P optimization
- **Interactive Management**: CLI-based mapping updates with real-time feedback
- **Resource Management**: Automatic room cleanup and memory leak prevention

### Configuration

The tool supports both YAML (.yml/.yaml) and JSON (.json) configuration files with enhanced fields:
- `mode`: "client" or "server"
- `roomId`: Shared secret for peer matching (use cryptographically secure strings)
- `signalingUrl`: Enhanced PHP signaling server endpoint (`signaling_server_enhanced.php` recommended)
- `stunServer`: STUN server for NAT traversal (optional, defaults to Google's STUN)
- `mappings`: Array of "protocol:localPort:remotePort" strings (client only, supports hot updates)

**Example Enhanced Configuration:**
```yaml
mode: client
roomId: "secure-random-room-id"
signalingUrl: "https://your-server.com/signaling_server_enhanced.php"
stunServer: "stun.l.google.com:19302"
mappings:
  - "udp:5000:53"    # DNS with UDP hole punching
  - "tcp:8080:80"    # HTTP with TCP relay
```

### LAN Detection

The tool implements multi-strategy LAN detection:
- Same public IP detection (most reliable for NAT scenarios)
- Private IP subnet analysis across standard ranges (192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x, 172.16-31.x.x)
- Automatic fallback to WAN connection when LAN detection fails

## Key Development Notes

### Architecture Changes
- Client uses `handleClientMode` function (run.go:37) for centralized registration
- Server uses `handleServerMode` function (run.go:40) with dynamic port allocation
- Each port mapping runs in its own goroutine (`handlePortMappingWithAllocatedPort` function)
- Server allocates ports using `allocatePortForMapping` function

### Data Structures
- `ClientRegistrationData`: Contains network info + mapping requirements
- `ServerRegistrationData`: Contains network info + port allocation results
- `ServerPortMapping`: Maps client requirements to allocated ports
